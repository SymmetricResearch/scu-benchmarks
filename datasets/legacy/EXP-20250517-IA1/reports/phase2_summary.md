# Phase 2 Summary: Provider Pricing Integration

## Experiment Status

* **Smoke Test**: ✅ Completed
  * Sample Fraction: 5%
  * Price entries: 3 (across AWS, Azure, Coreweave)

* **Full Run**: ✅ Completed
  * Sample Fraction: 100%
  * Total price entries: 1,872
  * Price entries per provider:
    * AWS: 288
    * Azure: 288
    * OCI: 288
    * Coreweave: 288
    * Linode: 216
    * Hetzner: 216
    * Nebius: 288

## Key Findings

* Successfully implemented pricing data processing pipeline
* Attribution values calculated for each price point
* Integration path established for Phase 3 cross-analysis

## Technical Achievements

* Unified pipeline handling both job data and pricing data
* Adaptable components that detect data type automatically
* Modular calculation skipping (interactions, VRAM filtering) based on data type

## Next Steps

* Implement Phase 3 cross-analysis to combine job attribution and pricing data
* Enhance dashboard visualizations for price time-series
* Prepare exporting and analysis tools for final report generation
