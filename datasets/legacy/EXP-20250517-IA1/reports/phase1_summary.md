# EXP-20250517-IA1 Summary

## Phase 1 Execution Status

* **Smoke Test**: ✅ Completed
  * Sample Fraction: 5%
  * Jobs Processed: alibaba_gpu2020 (1), alibaba_gpu2025 (4)
  * VRAM Filter: 66.7% drop (alibaba_gpu2020), 33.3% drop (alibaba_gpu2025)

* **Full Run**: ✅ Completed
  * Sample Fraction: 100%
  * Jobs Processed: alibaba_gpu2020 (59), alibaba_gpu2025 (59)
  * VRAM Filter: 41% drop (both datasets)
  * Generated Interactions: 1399 per dataset
  * Pricing Coverage: 56% (33/59 jobs)

## Observations

* Pipeline functions correctly at both sample and full scale
* VRAM filtering successfully limits jobs to RTX 3080 10GB constraints
* Stub model demonstrates concept, ready for real model integration
* All results properly stored in JSON format with metadata

## Next Phase

* Phase 2: Provider pricing data integration
* Expand provider mapping for better pricing coverage
* Enhance visualization in dashboard
* Update documentation with OpenAlex literature context
