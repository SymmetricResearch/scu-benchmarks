# Enhanced Experiment Report Template

## Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the experiment, its goals, and key findings in 3-4 paragraphs]

Key findings include:
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]
- [Finding 4]

## Attribution Architecture

The attribution system was implemented using a modular, cleanly separated architecture with the following key components:

1. **Workload Parsers**: Process specialized workload data
2. **Attribution Engine**: Calculate fair resource attribution using Shapley values
3. **Pricing Integration**: Map provider prices to resources
4. **Cross-Analysis**: Compare workloads across providers, identify arbitrage opportunities
5. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations of key metrics and findings
6. **OpenAlex Integration**: Connect analysis with relevant academic literature

This architecture ensures clean separation of concerns, with each component handling exactly one responsibility in the attribution pipeline.

## Provider Pricing Analysis

[Analyze provider pricing data, including normalized costs across providers]

| Dataset | Provider | Normalized Cost |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| [Dataset 1] | [Provider 1] | [Cost 1] |
| [Dataset 1] | [Provider 2] | [Cost 2] |
| [Dataset 2] | [Provider 1] | [Cost 3] |
| [Dataset 2] | [Provider 2] | [Cost 4] |

[Provider] consistently provided the most cost-effective pricing for the analyzed workloads, with costs approximately [X]% lower than [comparison provider] for equivalent resources.

## Arbitrage Opportunities

[Describe arbitrage opportunities identified between providers]

| Dataset | Cheaper Provider | Expensive Provider | Price Diff % | Savings Potential |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Dataset 1] | [Provider A] | [Provider B] | [X]% | [Y] |
| [Dataset 2] | [Provider C] | [Provider D] | [X]% | [Y] |

These arbitrage opportunities represent potential cost savings by shifting workloads between providers based on their specific resource requirements and pricing models.
