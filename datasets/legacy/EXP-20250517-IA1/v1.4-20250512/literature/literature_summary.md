## Implications for EXP-20250517-IA1

The literature review reveals several important implications for our experiment:

1. **Attribution Methodology**: Shapley value-based approaches continue to be state-of-the-art for fair resource attribution
2. **Workload Classification**: Domain-specific approaches yield better results than generic classification systems
3. **Cloud Pricing**: Dynamic pricing models and arbitrage opportunities remain understudied in academic literature
4. **Cross-Provider Analysis**: Few studies have comprehensively compared resource utilization across multiple cloud providers

These findings validate our approach to using Shapley attribution for resource allocation and our focus on cross-provider analysis to identify arbitrage opportunities.
