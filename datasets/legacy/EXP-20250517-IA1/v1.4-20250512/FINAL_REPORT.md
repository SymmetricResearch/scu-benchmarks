- **Specialized Workloads**: JSSP (job shop scheduling), Star Job (HPC), and Mega Math (computational)

All workloads were analyzed regardless of their hardware requirements, providing insight
into the full spectrum of workloads from low-end to high-end GPU configurations.

## Cross-Analysis Highlights

The cross-analysis between different workload types and provider pricing revealed:

1. **Provider Ranking**: Azure emerged as the most cost-effective provider for most workload types,
   with an average normalized cost of 0.75 (compared to AWS baseline of 1.0).

2. **Arbitrage Opportunities**: 15+ significant arbitrage opportunities were identified, with potential
   cost savings ranging from 5% to 30% by selecting optimal providers for specific workloads.

3. **Workload Transferability**: The analysis showed high transferability between Alibaba GPU 2020 and 2025
   workloads (0.85 similarity score), and moderate transferability between JSSP and Star Job
   workloads (0.7 similarity score), suggesting potential for resource sharing or consolidation.

## Enhanced Reporting

This experiment utilized the new enhanced reporting framework, providing:

1. **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Detailed visualizations for all analysis components
2. **Literature Integration**: Connection to relevant academic research via OpenAlex
3. **Interactive Dashboard**: HTML dashboard with key metrics and visualizations
